"""Print a pip constraints file pinning every dependency to its declared floor.

    python .github/scripts/floor_constraints.py [--dist NAME] EXTRA...

Reads the *installed* metadata of the distribution, so `pyproject.toml` stays
the single source of the bounds — a hand-written pin in a workflow drifts, and
pip silently upgrades past it. Requirements whose marker does not hold for the
running interpreter or for one of the named extras are skipped, as are
self-references (a `yaconfiglib[jinja2]`-style alias extra).

Exits 1 naming every kept requirement that declares no lower bound: an
unbounded dependency has no floor to test, which is the defect this guards
against.

Standard library plus `packaging`; no network. `.github/` is excluded from the
sdist, so this is a repository tool, not a shipped one.
